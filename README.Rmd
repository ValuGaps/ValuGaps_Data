# ValuGaps_Data

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This git repo allows you to access the data used in the ValuGaps project and understand the process of creating the dataset. If you only want to download the raw dataset, you can find it on OSF https://osf.io/9dw2j/?view_only=015b3489509c42cbb3d7bb38f0e02d39

If you want to work with the repo, you first have to clone it and download the data via the script `download_data.R`. This script will download the data from OSF and save it in the `data` folder. You can then run the script `clean_data.R` to create the dataset used in the ValuGaps project. This is the recommended dataset to use for the project, as it is cleaned and ready to use.
